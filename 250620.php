<dd>When I got up early this morning to feed the cats, I noticed the wind was blowing strangely. I went outside and above me was a mix of dark clouds and clear sky moving mostly from north to south, though winds on the ground were chaotic, blowing very strongly from different directions but only over small areas. But those winds were so strong that I was concerned about being under the trees in the yard west of the house, white pines that at worst have only shed moderate-sized limbs.
